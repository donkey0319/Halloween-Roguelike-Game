Hello! 

There are two folders in this folder:

The theme folder contains several drawings which are the themes we thought of. We made a Halloween theme, Sci-Fi Dragon theme, and Theft in Museum theme. We drew several concept photos for each theme, but I only put the photos that I drew in this folder. After the entire team voted, we ended up choosing the Halloween theme.

After deciding on the theme, we started to design the main character. We are inspired by the main character in Celeste and decided to make it a cute girl. Another member of the art team drew the t-pose and I made the 3D model.
